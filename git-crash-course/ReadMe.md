# Cloning

We can clone 3 ways: HTTPS, SSH, GitHub CLI.

## HTTPS

The command is:
```sh 
git clone https://github.com/M-Gabriel-V/GitHub-Foundations.git 
```

### Note!
```If the repo is public, no credentials are needed to copy.``` 

```BUT you will need credentials when pushing it back up.```

# Markdown

Learning how to work in Markdown requires you to know the commands:

## ' # ' 
Is used for titles, sub-titles, sub-sub-titles and so on. The more '#' are added, the smaller the size of the content.

## ' ``` '
Must be added before and after the content. The content will be placed into a highlighted box.

```Example```

## ' ``` + sh '
It will create a box that allow the user to copy the contents with a click. Notation is important! Otherwise, it will turn into a simple ' ``` '. Check the raw .md to see the notation.
```sh
Example
```
